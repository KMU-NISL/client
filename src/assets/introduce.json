Information security is a social and national issue rather than\n                        personal. Under these circumstances, we have established Next-Generation Information Security\n                        Laboratory(NISL). \"Next-Generation Information Security Technology\" includes internet of\n                        things(IoT) security, vehicle ad hoc network(VANET) security, FinTech security, information\n                        security service technology for the mobile Internet, and authentication technology for the\n                        various network security system. These are the core of the next-generation network security\n                        technology. NISL at Keimyung University will do its best to improve the information security\n                        field in Korea, meet international standards, and enhance its competitive edge in the rapidly\n                        changing information and telecommunication society."
